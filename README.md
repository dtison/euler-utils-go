**Golang Package of Utilities for Solving Project Euler Problems**

[Project Euler Official Site](https://projecteuler.net/) 

**There are no solutions here, only helper functions.**

This is a work in progress.  There are some things that could be organized better.  Pull requests are welcome.

I am new to the Golang ecosphere, but am learning using Project Euler problems.

After doing several of the Euler problems, you find several standard functions are reused frequently.

This package has functions to generate Prime numbers, find Prime factors, pandigital functions, GCD, Palindrome tests, etc.

If you are working on Project Euler in Go, these will help you.  In here you will find the raw materials with which to do these problems.

**TESTING**

I have not had a chance to write tests for these.  

The tests so far are **these functions get correct answers to the problems on Project Euler**.

So far, I have completed about 50 of them.
